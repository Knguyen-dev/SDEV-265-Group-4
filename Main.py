+ Header: Tkinter frame that represents the header of the application 

Constructor:
- master (App): 'App' Class instance

Attributes/Variables:
- master (App): 'App' class instance
- navbar (CTkFrame): Inner frame that that contains the label and the contains the container for the nav buttons
- navLabel (CTkLabel): Label that shows the text of the navbar 
- navBtnFrame (CTkFrame): Tkinter frame/container that has the buttons in the nav
- navBtns (Array): List that contains all of the tkinter buttons that are contained in the nav bar
- navBtnMap (Object/Map): Object/map that contains the text of the buttons (keys) and the name of the class/page that 
	the button is linked to. This allows buttons to link open certain pages when clicked

Methods:
- updateNavBtns(self): Adjusts the accessibility of the nav buttons based on their login state. 
- disableNavBtns(self): Disables the nav buttons from being used

Constructor:

Attributes/Variables:

'''
+ App: Root window of the tkinter or GUI application. It's our Main application window and it contains 
	data that we want to persist through different pages of the application.

Attributes/Variables:
- width (int): The viewport width of the client.
- height (int): The viewport height of the client. 
- currentPage (CTkFrame): The page that the application is currently rendering 
- loggedInUser (User): Represents the user that is currently logged into the application. If no user is logged in then
	this value is None.
- currentStory (Story): Can represent the saved story object that the user is continuing to write, or it represents the story
	that the user is using to remix off of. 
- isSavedStory (Bool): If true, currentStory is the story the user is continuing. Else, this means isRemixed story is True or False
- isRemixedStory (Bool): If true, currentStory is the story the user is using to remix off of. Note as a result their remixed story 
	isn't saved in the database yet. Else, this means isSavedStory is true or false.

NOTE: If both isSavedStory and isRemixedStory are false, then the user is not remixing a story and they aren't continuing a saved story.
	Basically it means the user is writing a brand new story that hasn't been saved into the database yet.

- unsavedStoryMessages (Array): Array of 'Message' objects that the user and AI have generated for a story, but they haven't been
	saved and linked to a story object in the database yet. These would represent the messages in their most recent chat session.
- engine (SqlAlchemy Engine): Sqlalchemy engine object that helps us connect to the database
- Session (SqlAlchemy Session Maker): Customized constructor that makes session objects for our database 
- session (SqlAlchemy Session): Session class instance that's used to interact with the database 
- header (CTkFrame): Header of the application
- footer (CTkFrame): Footer of the application

Methods:
- getPage(self, pageName): Searches for and returns a class/module with name pageName. This class is a tkinter frame and 
	is an individual page in our GUI application. 
- openPage(self, pageName, *args): Opens and loads a page in our tkinter application that has the name pageName.
	It passes, the 'App' class and then any potential arguments that the pageName class may take as parameters
- logoutUser(self): Logs out the currently logged in user from our application.
